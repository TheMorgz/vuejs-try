# vuejs-try
Messing around with VueJS. Learning purposes.

### Mess around locally
- Git clone this on to a location on your machine.
- cd into the desired location.
- then run the following (Assuming you're on a Unix environment):
 
```sh
$ php -S localhost:8080
```

- This should spin up a local PHP server, on port 8080, where you will see the results of the code in this repo.

### NB: This is strictly messing around. Gotta learn ðŸ™ˆ
